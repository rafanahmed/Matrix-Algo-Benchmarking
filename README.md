This repository is dedicated to exploring, benchmarking, and visualizing various matrix multiplication algorithms, from the classic naive method to more advanced approaches like Strassen's algorithm and insights from recent AI-driven discoveries.


Objective:
1.  Implement several matrix multiplication algorithms.
2.  Benchmark their runtime performance across different matrix sizes.
3.  Create visualizations and animations to better understand their mechanics and efficiency trade-offs.

## Current Focus
* Setting up the foundational benchmarking framework.
* Implementing and verifying core algorithms.
