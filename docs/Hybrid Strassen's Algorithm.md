## Building the Hybrid Strassen's Algorithm

### Concept and Purpose:

**The Problem: Strassen's Overhead**
While Strassen's algorithm is asymptotically faster than the standard algorithm, it has a higher "overhead." For each recursive step, it performs many matrix additions and subtractions and manages the recursive function calls. For small matrices, this overhead costs more time than is saved by the reduction in multiplications.

**The Solution: A Hybrid Approach**
The most common and practical way to implement Strassen's algorithm is to create a **hybrid** version. This algorithm provides the best of both worlds by combining two strategies.

**Logic**:
1.  **Divide**: The algorithm uses Strassen's recursive "divide and conquer" strategy for large matrices.
2.  **Switch**: When the recursive calls break the sub-matrices down to a size that is smaller than a specified **threshold**, the recursion stops.
3.  **Conquer with an Optimized Base Case**: For these smaller "base case" matrices, the algorithm switches to a fast, iterative algorithm (like NumPy's optimized `@` operator) to finish the computation.

This approach leverages Strassen's asymptotic advantage for large problems while using a practically faster algorithm for the small problems where Strassen's overhead is too high.

### Implementation with Padding and a Threshold:

**Mathematical Foundation**:
The mathematics are identical to the standard Strassen's algorithm. The only change is the condition under which the recursion stops.

**Logic**:
1.  **User-Facing Wrapper**: A main function, `hybrid_strassen_padding`, handles padding the matrices to the nearest power of two, just like our robust Strassen's implementation.
2.  **Modified Recursive Helper**: An internal function, `hybrid_strassens_algorithm`, performs the recursion. Its base case is no longer `if n == 1`, but rather `if n <= threshold`. When this condition is met, it calls an optimized standard algorithm instead of recursing further.

**Code Implementation**:
```python
import numpy as np
import math

# Assume 'optimized_standard_algorithm' is defined in the same file
def optimized_standard_algorithm(A, B):
    return A @ B

def hybrid_strassen_padding(A, B, threshold=64):
    """
    User-facing function for the hybrid Strassen's algorithm.
    Handles padding and calls the recursive hybrid helper.
    """
    n_a_rows, m_a_cols = A.shape
    n_b_rows, p_b_cols = B.shape
    if m_a_cols != n_b_rows:
        raise ValueError("Incompatible matrix dimensions.")

    max_dim = max(n_a_rows, m_a_cols, p_b_cols)
    next_pow_of_2 = int(2**math.ceil(math.log2(max_dim)))

    A_padded = np.zeros((next_pow_of_2, next_pow_of_2))
    B_padded = np.zeros((next_pow_of_2, next_pow_of_2))

    A_padded[:n_a_rows, :m_a_cols] = A
    B_padded[:n_b_rows, :p_b_cols] = B

    C_padded = hybrid_strassens_algorithm(A_padded, B_padded, threshold)

    C = C_padded[:n_a_rows, :p_b_cols]
    return C

def hybrid_strassens_algorithm(A, B, threshold):
    """
    Internal recursive function for the hybrid Strassen's algorithm.
    """
    n = A.shape[0]

    # MODIFIED BASE CASE: Switch to a faster algorithm for small matrices
    if n <= threshold:
        return optimized_standard_algorithm(A, B)

    # RECURSIVE STEP: Identical to the standard Strassen's algorithm
    else:
        mid = n // 2
        A11, A12, A21, A22 = A[:mid, :mid], A[:mid, mid:], A[mid:, :mid], A[mid:, mid:]
        B11, B12, B21, B22 = B[:mid, :mid], B[:mid, mid:], B[mid:, :mid], B[mid:, mid:]
        
        # Recursive calls now call the hybrid function itself
        p1 = hybrid_strassens_algorithm((A11 + A22), (B11 + B22), threshold)
        p2 = hybrid_strassens_algorithm((A21 + A22), B11, threshold)
        p3 = hybrid_strassens_algorithm(A11, (B12 - B22), threshold)
        p4 = hybrid_strassens_algorithm(A22, (B21 - B11), threshold)
        p5 = hybrid_strassens_algorithm((A11 + A12), B22, threshold)
        p6 = hybrid_strassens_algorithm((A21 - A11), (B11 + B12), threshold)
        p7 = hybrid_strassens_algorithm((A12 - A22), (B21 + B22), threshold)
        
        C11 = p1 + p4 - p5 + p7
        C12 = p3 + p5
        C21 = p2 + p4
        C22 = p1 - p2 + p3 + p6

        left_half = np.vstack((C11, C21))
        right_half = np.vstack((C12, C22))
        C = np.hstack((left_half, right_half))
        
        return C
```

Notes:

- threshold: Finding the optimal value for the threshold is a key part of performance tuning. It depends heavily on the specific hardware and the efficiency of the base case implementation (in our case, how fast NumPy's @ operator is). Common values are 32, 64, or 128.
