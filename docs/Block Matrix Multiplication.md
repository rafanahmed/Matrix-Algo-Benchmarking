## Building the Block Matrix Multiplication (Tiling) Algorithm

### Concept and Purpose:

**The Problem: The Memory Wall**
The naive, standard algorithm iterates through matrices in a way that can be very inefficient for modern CPUs. Accessing data from main system RAM is thousands of times slower than accessing data from the small, fast memory located directly on the CPU, known as the **cache**. The naive algorithm's memory access pattern often requires fetching new data from RAM for each step of the inner loop, creating a performance bottleneck.

**The Solution: Tiling for Cache Efficiency**
Block matrix multiplication, also known as **tiling**, improves practical performance by reorganizing the calculations to be more "cache-friendly." It does **not** reduce the total number of arithmetic operations—it is still an $O(N^3)$ algorithm—but it significantly speeds up the process by improving **data locality**.

**Logic**:
The core idea is to break the large matrices into smaller, square sub-matrices called **blocks** or **tiles**. The multiplication is then performed on these small blocks.

1.  **Partition**: Divide the input matrices $A$, $B$, and the result matrix $C$ into small blocks of a fixed `block_size`.
2.  **Multiply Blocks**: Perform the multiplication by iterating through the blocks. The core operation becomes multiplying two small blocks that are likely to fit entirely within the CPU cache. This allows the CPU to perform all necessary calculations on these small blocks without having to constantly wait for data from slow main RAM.

### The Six Nested Loops:

**Mathematical Foundation**:
The formula appears identical to the standard algorithm, but the elements being multiplied are now entire sub-matrices (blocks), not just single numbers:
$$C_{ij} = \sum_{k} A_{ik} \cdot B_{kj}$$
Where $A_{ik}$ and $B_{kj}$ represent the small blocks of the larger matrices.

**Logic**:
Instead of three nested loops, this approach uses **six**. They can be thought of as two sets of three:
1.  **Outer Loops (Block Iteration)**: Three loops (`ii`, `jj`, `kk`) that iterate through the matrices block by block, stepping in increments of the `block_size`.
2.  **Inner Loops (Element Iteration)**: Three loops (`i`, `j`, `k`) identical to the naive algorithm, but operating only *within* the boundaries of the small block selected by the outer loops.

This structure ensures that when the inner loops are executing, all the data they need is likely already in the fast CPU cache.

**Code Implementation**:
```python
import numpy as np

def block_multiply_algorithm(A, B, block_size):
    """
    Computes matrix product C = A * B using block matrix multiplication (tiling).

    Args:
        A (np.ndarray): The first matrix.
        B (np.ndarray): The second matrix.
        block_size (int): The dimension of the square blocks to use.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: The resulting product matrix.
    """
    N, M = A.shape
    _, P = B.shape
    C = np.zeros((N, P))

    # Outer loops iterate over the blocks in increments of block_size
    for ii in range(0, N, block_size):
        for jj in range(0, P, block_size):
            for kk in range(0, M, block_size):

                # Inner loops perform a standard multiplication on the sub-matrices
                for i in range(ii, min(ii + block_size, N)):
                    for j in range(jj, min(jj + block_size, P)):
                        for k in range(kk, min(kk + block_size, M)):
                            C[i, j] += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
    
    return C
```
Notes:

- block_size: This is a critical tuning parameter. The optimal size depends on the specific CPU's cache size. Typical values might be 16, 32, or 64.

- min(...): This logic ensures the algorithm works correctly even if the matrix dimensions are not perfectly divisible by the block_size, preventing the loops from going out of bounds.
